# Rust implementation of python's dictor lib

This lib is a re-implementation of python's [dictor](https://github.com/perfecto25/dictor)
ported to Rust using [Pyo3](https://github.com/perfecto25/dictor) and [maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin)


## Purpose

To learn Pyo3. Besides, to build a faster and reliable version of python's implementation:

```
$ ~/rust/pyo3_projects/dicto_r/dicto_r$ python perf.py py
--- 0.0016968250274658203 seconds ---
$ ~/rust/pyo3_projects/dicto_r/dicto_r$ python perf.py rust
--- 0.0004475116729736328 seconds ---
```
This implementation is 4x times faster than python's.

## Pypy release

Each version is build and released into [Pypy](https://pypy.org) so it can be treated as any other regular python lib

## Develop 

`src/lib` contains it's own set of rust test. However, to have a full testing cycle including python, __maturin__ helps by building a wheel and installing it on our current python environment:

```
$ maturin develop
...
Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.02s
ðŸ“¦ Built wheel for CPython 3.10 to /tmp/.tmpB45abW/dicto_r-0.1.0-cp310-cp310-linux_x86_64.whl
ðŸ›  Installed dicto_r-0.1.0
```
As a common practice for using maturin and pyo3, a directory with the same name as the lib is created containing the python helpers to work with the lib from python's side

In this case, there's only a test.py file exported from original __dictor__ lib within the resources files to run exactly the same test battery in rust implementation as in python.



## Build for release

While `maturin develop` builds and install a version of the lib, bear in mind the build is not optimized for production, so if compared to python's it will be significantly slower. If you build for prod however, the `.whl` generated can be installed and used at the best level of optimization:

```
$ maturin build --release
...
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.02s
ðŸ“¦ Built wheel for CPython 3.10 to /home/nico/rust/pyo3_projects/dicto_r/target/wheels/dicto_r-0.1.0-cp310-cp310-manylinux_2_24_x86_64.whl

```
